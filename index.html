            <p>I’m a designer who codes. I’ve worked internationally, in-house, and remotely on projects for leading brands, agencies, startups, and charities. I care deeply about creating world-class, useful, and beautiful products that help people and make a difference. That's why I am learning and mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the Web Development Hero.</p>
